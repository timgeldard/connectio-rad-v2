# SPC Native Migration Readiness Checklist

**Date:** 2026-05-21
**Status:** Object inventory, types, and schemas partially complete — 2026-05-21 evidence session
**Purpose:** Gate checklist before implementing native V2 SPC Databricks routes

> This checklist must be completed before any V2 native SPC route (either V1 proxy or direct
> Databricks API) is implemented, enabled, or tested against live data. All items are currently
> unverified. No item may be marked complete without the evidence documented in the linked
> verification documents.

## 1. Object Inventory

- [ ] **Object inventory complete** — `SHOW TABLES IN connected_plant_uat.gold LIKE '*spc*'` run
  and all objects listed in `spc-databricks-source-verification.md` Section 9.1
  - Evidence required: Screenshot or table output from Databricks SQL editor
  - Document: [spc-databricks-source-verification.md](./spc-databricks-source-verification.md)

  - `spc_quality_metric_subgroup_v`
  - `spc_locked_limits`
  - `spc_material_dim_mv`
  - `spc_plant_material_dim_mv`
  - `spc_characteristic_dim_mv`
  - Evidence required: `SHOW TABLES` output confirming all present

---

## 2. Object Types Confirmed

- [ ] **`spc_quality_metrics` confirmed as AI/BI Metric View** — NOT a signal or alarm table
  - Evidence required: `DESCRIBE EXTENDED spc_quality_metrics` output showing Type = METRIC_VIEW
  - Document: [spc-databricks-source-verification.md](./spc-databricks-source-verification.md) Section 6

  - Evidence required: `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` Type field

- [ ] **`spc_capability_detail_mv` confirmed as MATERIALIZED_VIEW**
  - Evidence required: `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` Type field

---

## 3. Columns / Data Types Confirmed

- [x] **`spc_quality_metric_subgroup_v` columns verified against live DDL — with SCHEMA DIFFERENCES**
  - 34 columns confirmed 2026-05-21; significant differences from V1 expectations
  - V1-expected columns ABSENT: `sample_id`, `result_value`, `sample_timestamp`, `subgroup_mean`, `subgroup_range`, `subgroup_sd`, `inspection_lot_id`, `unit_of_measure`
  - Replacements: `value` (not `result_value`); `batch_date` (not `sample_timestamp`); `sum_value`/`batch_n` for mean; `batch_range` for range
  - New columns: `material_name`, `plant_name`, `any_rejection`, `any_acceptance`, `normality_type`, `spec_type`, etc.
  - `usl_spec` and `lsl_spec` ARE present in this view
  - Evidence: 2026-05-21 Databricks CLI verification; see spc-databricks-source-verification.md Section 9.3
  - Document: [spc-data-model-grain-assessment.md](./spc-data-model-grain-assessment.md)

- [x] **`spc_locked_limits` columns verified against live DDL — 19 columns confirmed**
  - All 19 columns confirmed 2026-05-21; matches V1 migration-014 expectations
  - Column name discrepancy RESOLVED: `baseline_from`/`baseline_to` confirmed (not `effective_from`/`effective_to`); `locking_note` confirmed (not `provenance`)
  - No `usl`/`lsl` columns — spec limits are in subgroup view, NOT in locked_limits
  - Evidence: 2026-05-21 Databricks CLI verification; see spc-control-limit-provenance-verification.md
  - Document: [spc-control-limit-provenance-verification.md](./spc-control-limit-provenance-verification.md)

- [!] **`spc_capability_detail_mv` columns verified** — BLOCKED: object NOT FOUND in UAT
  - Finding: migration 013 not applied; all Cp/Cpk/Pp/Ppk columns unavailable
  - Document: [spc-capability-verification.md](./spc-capability-verification.md)

---

## 4. Grain Confirmed

- [ ] **`spc_quality_metric_subgroup_v` grain confirmed**
  - Must confirm: grain is `(material_id, plant_id, mic_id, operation_id, batch_id, sample_id)`
    with no duplicates, OR grain is understood if duplicates exist
  - Evidence required: HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 query returning 0 rows (or explanation)
  - Document: [spc-data-model-grain-assessment.md](./spc-data-model-grain-assessment.md)

- [ ] **`spc_locked_limits` grain confirmed**
  - Must confirm: whether multiple rows per (material_id, mic_id, plant_id, operation_id, chart_type)
    exist and if so, how to select the current one
  - Evidence required: HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 query result

- [ ] **`spc_capability_detail_mv` grain confirmed**
  - Must confirm: one row per (material_id, plant_id, mic_id)
  - Evidence required: HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 query result

  - Document: [spc-navigation-model-verification.md](./spc-navigation-model-verification.md)

---

## 6. Locked Limit Source Confirmed

  - Evidence required: SELECT * LIMIT 20 showing populated limit values
  - Document: [spc-control-limit-provenance-verification.md](./spc-control-limit-provenance-verification.md)

- [ ] **Limit column name discrepancy resolved**
  - `usl`/`lsl` vs `spec_signature`, `effective_from` vs `baseline_from` — resolved by DDL check
  - Evidence required: `DESCRIBE TABLE` output confirming exact column names

- [ ] **Approval/provenance derivation confirmed**
  - `locked_by` field confirmed present and how approvalState is derived from it
  - Evidence required: Sample rows showing `locked_by` values

## 7. Control vs Specification Limits Separated

---

## 10. At Least One Golden Candidate Verified

- [ ] **Discovery query run** and at least one material/plant/MIC combination with >= 20 sample
  points found in `spc_quality_metric_subgroup_v`
  - Evidence required: discovery query results
  - Document: [golden-spc-candidates.md](./golden-spc-candidates.md)

- [ ] **Candidate entry created in golden-spc-candidates.md** with all fields populated from

- [ ] **Chart type rename mapping confirmed** (V1 `imr` → V2 `individuals`, etc.)

- [ ] **`SPCAlarmHistoryItem` gap accepted** — acknowledged that no stored alarm history exists
  in V1, and the panel will remain mock-only or be deferred

---

## 12. Source Truthfulness Wording Updated

- [ ] **`spc-known-limitations.md` updated** with any new findings from verification
  - Document: [spc-known-limitations.md](./spc-known-limitations.md)

- [ ] **SPC README updated** if implementation status changes

- [ ] **`domain-readiness-index.md` SPC section updated** with current verified status
  - Document: [domain-readiness-index.md](../../../docs/readiness/domain-readiness-index.md)

- [ ] **No UI changes show SPC data as production-ready** until the above are all complete

---

## 13. Tests Planned

- [ ] **Mock adapter tests remain green** — no existing mock adapter tests broken by verification
  findings

- [ ] **New contract tests designed** for legacy-api adapter (once proxy routes are implemented)

- [ ] **New column verification tests designed** for Databricks adapter (once native routes exist)

---

## 14. UAT Evidence Template Prepared

## Go / No-Go Criteria

### Proceed with V2 SPC live implementation (Option 1: V1 Proxy) if:

- Items 1, 2, 3 (object/column verification) are complete
- Item 5 (navigation model) is confirmed material-first
- Item 6 (locked limits) has at least one row
- Item 10 (golden candidate) has at least one verified candidate
- V1 SPC app is confirmed reachable from V2 Databricks Apps environment

### Proceed with V2 SPC native Databricks implementation (Option 2) if:

- ALL items in this checklist are complete
- V2 contract mapping is fully resolved (no "pending" or "unknown" confidence values)
- Signal computation approach is decided and documented in an ADR
- Capability MV refresh cycle documented and staleness handling designed
- At least one golden candidate has been end-to-end tested

### Do NOT proceed if any of the following are true:

- `spc_quality_metric_subgroup_v` does not exist or has zero rows
- `material_id` is absent from `spc_locked_limits`
- No golden candidate can be identified
- Unity Catalog / OAuth access is blocked in the V2 deployment environment
- Column names differ materially from V1 source documentation and the discrepancies
  are not documented and resolved
- Any SPC chart panel shows "In control" or "No signals" in a way that implies
  a verified process state — UI truthfulness must be confirmed first
