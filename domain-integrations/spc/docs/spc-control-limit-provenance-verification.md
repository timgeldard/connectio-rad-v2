## 1. Purpose

This document provides a structured approach to verify the control-limit provenance in V1's
`spc_locked_limits` table before V2 uses it as the authoritative source for control chart
limit rendering.

Key questions:
1. Which columns in `spc_locked_limits` exist and are populated with data?
2. Are these production-suitable control limits, or are they UAT/test fixtures?
3. Is there a meaningful distinction between control limits (UCL/LCL) and specification
   limits (USL/LSL) in the stored data?
4. What is the approval / provenance state of the locked limits?
5. Do effective date or baseline columns exist to determine limit currency?

## 2. Background: V1 Control Limit Architecture

### 2.1 Dual-mode limits (from V1 source analysis)

V1 SPC uses a dual-mode control-limit system, user-selectable via `limitsMode` preference:

| Mode | Source | Mechanism |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `live` (default) | `spc_quality_metric_subgroup_v` subgroup data | Computed at runtime in React frontend using AIAG constants: UCL = X̄̄ + A₂R̄ for xbar-r chart. CL = X̄̄. LCL = X̄̄ − A₂R̄. |
| `locked` | `spc_locked_limits` table | Stored frozen limits per (material_id, mic_id, plant_id, operation_id, chart_type). |

**Implication for V2:** V2 must decide whether to expose both modes or lock to one.
The `ControlChartSeries.limitProvenance` field in V2 distinguishes between these.

### 2.2 Column discrepancy — requires DDL resolution

Two V2 documents reference different column names for `spc_locked_limits`.
This discrepancy MUST be resolved by running `DESCRIBE TABLE` against live UAT DDL.

| Field concept | `spc-v1-source-discovery.md` | `spc-v2-migration-assessment.md` | Live DDL (to verify) |
|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Specification limits | `usl`, `lsl` | Not listed (may be in `spec_signature`) | — not verified — |
| Lock validity start | `effective_from` | `baseline_from` | — not verified — |
| Lock validity end | `effective_to` | `baseline_to` | — not verified — |
| Provenance note | `provenance` | `locking_note` | — not verified — |
| Spec fingerprint | Not listed | `spec_signature` | — not verified — |

The live `DESCRIBE TABLE` output resolves this. Use that output as the definitive schema.

---

## 3. Verification Queries

### 3.1 Full DDL — run first

```sql
DESCRIBE TABLE connected_plant_uat.gold.spc_locked_limits;
```

Look for: all column names, data types, nullability constraints.
This is the single most important query for resolving the column name discrepancy above.

```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE connected_plant_uat.gold.spc_locked_limits;
```

This gives the full DDL including COMMENT strings from V1 migrations.

### 3.2 Sample rows — capture representative limit values

```sql
SELECT *
FROM connected_plant_uat.gold.spc_locked_limits
LIMIT 20;
```

### 3.3 Grain check — are there duplicate limit sets per (material, mic, chart_type)?

```sql
SELECT
  material_id,
  mic_id,
  plant_id,
  operation_id,
  chart_type,
  COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM connected_plant_uat.gold.spc_locked_limits
GROUP BY material_id, mic_id, plant_id, operation_id, chart_type
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY row_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

If rows are returned: multiple limit sets exist for the same key. V2 must filter by effective
date (or baseline date) to select the current set.

### 3.4 Limit values — are UCL/LCL/CL populated?

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
  SUM(CASE WHEN cl IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_cl,
  SUM(CASE WHEN ucl IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_ucl,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lcl IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_lcl,
  SUM(CASE WHEN ucl_r IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_ucl_r,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lcl_r IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_lcl_r,
  SUM(CASE WHEN sigma_within IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_sigma_within
FROM connected_plant_uat.gold.spc_locked_limits;
```

### 3.5 Spec limits — are USL/LSL present? (column names unconfirmed)

Run ONLY after `DESCRIBE TABLE` confirms which column names are present.

```sql
-- Try both variants; use the one that succeeds:

-- Variant A (from spc-v1-source-discovery.md):
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN usl IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_usl,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lsl IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_lsl
FROM connected_plant_uat.gold.spc_locked_limits;

-- Variant B (from spc-v2-migration-assessment.md):
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN spec_signature IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_spec_signature
FROM connected_plant_uat.gold.spc_locked_limits;
```

### 3.6 Approval / provenance state

```sql
SELECT
  locked_by,
  COUNT(*) AS limit_count
FROM connected_plant_uat.gold.spc_locked_limits
GROUP BY locked_by
ORDER BY limit_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

This shows who locked limits and how many. If `locked_by` contains UAT/test user identities,
these limits may not be production-approved.

### 3.7 Effective date / baseline coverage

Run ONLY after `DESCRIBE TABLE` confirms which date columns are present.

```sql
-- Check whether baseline_from / baseline_to or effective_from / effective_to exist and are set

-- Try this (adapts to whatever name DESCRIBE TABLE reveals):
SELECT
  MIN(locked_at) AS earliest_lock,
  MAX(locked_at) AS latest_lock,
  COUNT(*) AS total_locked
FROM connected_plant_uat.gold.spc_locked_limits;
```

### 3.8 Chart type distribution

```sql
SELECT
  chart_type,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM connected_plant_uat.gold.spc_locked_limits
GROUP BY chart_type
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

This confirms which V1 chart types have locked limits (compare to V1 enum: `imr`, `xbar_r`,
`xbar_s`, `p_chart`, `np_chart`, `c_chart`, `u_chart`).

## 5. Limit Classification

After verifying the provenance matrix, classify each limit row:

| Classification | Meaning | V2 Treatment |
|----------------|---------|--------------|
| `production-suitable` | Locked by approved quality engineer for production use, effective dates current | Show with `approvalState: 'approved'`, `limitProvenance: 'imported-from-approved-source'` |
| `UAT-suitable with caveats` | Locked in UAT by test user; dates reasonable; values plausible | Show with `approvalState: 'pending-validation'`, sandbox warning |
| `usable only as reference` | Locked but expired, or locked by unknown identity | Show as reference only; strong UI warning |
| `insufficient without V2 enrichment` | Columns present but nullable values missing (e.g., ucl is NULL) | Mark as `limitProvenance: 'unknown'`, `approvalState: 'unavailable'` |
| `unknown` | Cannot determine without more data | Default until verification completes |

---

## 6. Control Limits vs Specification Limits

An important distinction for V2:

| Limit type | Purpose | Source in V1 |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Control limits** (UCL/LCL/CL) | Determine when the process is statistically out of control. Statistical, not engineering. | Computed from subgroup statistics (AIAG constants) or stored in `spc_locked_limits.ucl/lcl/cl` |
| **Specification limits** (USL/LSL) | Engineering tolerances — the boundaries of acceptable product. Set by product specification. | `spc_quality_metric_subgroup_v.usl_spec/lsl_spec` or `spc_locked_limits.usl/lsl` (column name unconfirmed) |

**V2 must not mix these.** Exceeding specification limits is a different event from a WECO/Nelson
rule violation. `ControlChartSeries.upperSpecLimit` and `ControlChartSeries.lowerSpecLimit`
are distinct from `upperControlLimit` and `lowerControlLimit`.

The verification queries above must confirm which source column provides USL/LSL for V2 to
populate both correctly.
