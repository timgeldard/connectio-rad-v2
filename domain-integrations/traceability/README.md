# di-traceability

Batch traceability investigation cockpit for the ConnectIO V2 platform.

Gives quality and food-safety users a single view of a suspect batch: what it is, where it came from, what it went into, which customers may be exposed, what stock remains, and what evidence is complete or missing.

## Architecture

```
trace2-queries.ts       TanStack Query hooks (one per data domain)
       │
trace2-adapter.ts       Adapter facade — returns AdapterResult<T> ({ ok, data } | { ok, error })
       │
trace2-adapter-factory  Selects mock or legacy-api adapter based on config
       │
trace2-mock-data.ts     Realistic mock responses (Phase 1 fixture)
```

### Views and panels

- **`views/overview-view.tsx`** — Main investigation cockpit: `InvestigationSummary` header + 6 evidence panels + `EvidencePackReadiness` checklist
- **`views/trace-tree-view.tsx`** — Bidirectional lineage graph
- **`views/customer-exposure-view.tsx`** — Delivery and customer exposure detail
- **`views/supplier-exposure-view.tsx`** — Upstream vendor/receipt exposure
- **`views/mass-balance-view.tsx`** — Input/output variance
- **`views/recall-readiness-view.tsx`** — Recall risk assessment

Panels are stateless cards (≥320px) that accept a `Trace2AdapterRequest` and render a single data domain.

### Evidence confidence

`calculateConfidence()` in `components/EvidenceConfidence.tsx` scores evidence completeness across 6 sectors (lineage, customers, mass balance, quality, CoA, suppliers) and drives the `EvidenceConfidenceBadge` and `EvidencePackReadiness` checklist on the cockpit.

## Running tests

```sh
pnpm nx test di-traceability
pnpm nx typecheck di-traceability
```

## Status

Hybrid readiness. `BatchHeaderPanel` has a browser-verified `legacy-api` path, and `TraceGraphPanel` has a browser-verified native `databricks-api` path. Several other trace panels remain mock-only or are still blocked on DDL/source verification. A new **Trace Assistant Pilot** view now provides a deterministic, domain-scoped assistant surface limited to focal batch and visible graph evidence. See `docs/production-readiness-checklist.md` and `docs/traceability-genie-readiness-pack.md` for the current gates.
