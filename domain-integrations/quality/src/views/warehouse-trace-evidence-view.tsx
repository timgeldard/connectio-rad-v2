 * Warehouse & Trace Evidence view for the Quality Batch Release workspace.

 * @remarks
 * Provides a consolidated view of stock-level and traceability risk evidence
 * needed during release: warehouse hold status, trace exposure for the specific
 * release case, related investigations from traceability, and SPC signals
 * derived from the warehouse context (using `releaseCaseId` and `batchId`).
 * The SPC request is constructed inline from the warehouse request so the
 * parent workspace only needs to manage three request objects.
