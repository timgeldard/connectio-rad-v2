# UAT Smoke-Test Checklist — ConnectIO V2

**Environment:** `https://connectio-v2-604667594731808.8.azure.databricksapps.com`
**Last updated:** 2026-05-18

---

## f.txt Pre-flight baseline (2026-05-18)

**Commit tested:** `0b9d86895dd0ad0e68e02cf56ba2553c5c36e9a1` (Merge PR #16 — EnvMon scope seeding fix)

**Local tests run before UAT:**
```
npm exec nx -- run-many -t test --all --passWithNoTests   → 12 projects, all PASS
cd apps/api && python -m pytest tests/ -x -q              → 682 passed
```

**Deployment config verified from `app.yaml`:**
- `BACKEND_ADAPTER_MODE=databricks-api` ✓
- `DATABRICKS_HOST=https://adb-604667594731808.8.azuredatabricks.net` ✓
- `SQL_WAREHOUSE_ID=e76480b94bea6ed5` ✓
- `TRACE_CATALOG=connected_plant_uat`, `TRACE_SCHEMA=gold` ✓
- `POH_CATALOG=connected_plant_uat`, `CQ_CATALOG=connected_plant_uat` ✓
- `WH360_CATALOG` — **NOT SET** — all 5 WH360 routes will return 503 until configured
- `WH360_SCHEMA` — **NOT SET** — defaults to `"wh360"` in object_resolver.py
- `user_api_scopes: [sql]` ✓ — no SPN/PAT config ✓

**Pre-flight findings:**
- SPC: `SPCSandboxBanner` was absent from 4 of 6 view tabs (active-signals, capability, alarm-history, chart-configuration-readonly). Fixed pre-UAT based on code audit — UAT to confirm by tab-walking each view.
- Trace: WITH RECURSIVE implementation merged on main — prior BV (C12–C15) was against iterative approach; fresh verification required.
- WH360: Config-blocked — `WH360_CATALOG` unknown from available sources. Cannot be derived from `databricks.yml`, `app.yaml`, or docs. User must supply the UAT catalog name before WH360 routes can be tested.

## Section A — Deployment smoke test (PASSED 2026-05-17)

These tests confirm the app deploys, starts, and serves its static UI. No data connectivity is required.

- [x] `databricks apps get connectio-v2` shows `state: RUNNING`
- [x] Root URL loads (`https://connectio-v2-604667594731808.8.azure.databricksapps.com`)
- [x] React shell renders (workspace navigation visible)
- [x] Static assets load (JS, CSS, fonts — no 404s in browser network tab)
- [ ] `/health` responds `{"status": "ok"}` — **not yet manually confirmed** (endpoint exists in code; confirm in browser)

---

## Section B — Legacy-api smoke test (PENDING — blocked by V1 apps STOPPED)

These tests confirm the V2 → V1 proxy path works end-to-end. Requires V1 Databricks Apps to be running.

**Prerequisite:** Start the V1 apps. Contact the V1 team or restart via:
```bash
databricks apps start trace2          # or whichever app name applies
databricks apps start connectedquality
databricks apps start poh
databricks apps start wh360
```

Once V1 apps are running, verify each route in sequence.

### B1 — Trace2 batch header

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://connectio-v2-604667594731808.8.azure.databricksapps.com/api/trace2/batch-header \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: <auth-cookie-from-browser>" \
  -d '{"material_id": "<known-id>", "batch_id": "<known-id>"}' | jq .
```

- [ ] Returns HTTP 200 with data (not mock, not 503)
- [ ] `source` field in response is `legacy-api`
- [ ] No 502 (would indicate firewall/private-link issue between Apps network and V1)

### B2 — CQ lab plants

```bash
curl -s https://connectio-v2-604667594731808.8.azure.databricksapps.com/api/cq/lab/plants \
  -H "Cookie: <auth-cookie-from-browser>" | jq .
```

- [ ] Returns HTTP 200 with plant list
- [ ] `source` field is `legacy-api`

### B3 — POH order header

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://connectio-v2-604667594731808.8.azure.databricksapps.com/api/por/order-header \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: <auth-cookie-from-browser>" \
  -d '{"process_order_id": "<known-id>"}' | jq .
```

- [ ] Returns HTTP 200 with order header
- [ ] `source` field is `legacy-api`

### B4 — Expected failures while V1 STOPPED

While V1 apps are STOPPED, all routes above should return:
- HTTP 503 with `{"detail": "..."}` — not a V2 defect, expected behaviour

| Route | HTTP status while V1 stopped | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/trace2/batch-header` | Expected 503 | |
| `GET /api/cq/lab/plants` | Expected 503 | |
| `POST /api/por/order-header` | Expected 503 | |
| `POST /api/wh360/warehouse-summary` | Expected 503 | |

---

## Section C — Native Databricks smoke test (ACTIVE — browser verification pending)

These tests confirm V2 can query Databricks directly using end-user OAuth.

**Current state (2026-05-17):**
- `BACKEND_ADAPTER_MODE=databricks-api` — native reads active for CQ lab plants and POH order header
- `DATABRICKS_HOST`, `SQL_WAREHOUSE_ID`, `POH_CATALOG`, `CQ_CATALOG` set as literals in `app.yaml`
- `sql` OAuth scope added to app (`effective_user_api_scopes: ["sql", "iam.current-user:read", "iam.access-control:read"]`)
- All SQL column names confirmed from live DDL (connected_plant_uat, 2026-05-17)
- CLI-based curl tests cannot verify end-to-end — CLI tokens bypass the Databricks Apps OAuth consent flow and don't carry the `sql` scope. **Browser testing required.**

### C1 — Prerequisites (COMPLETE)

- [x] `BACKEND_ADAPTER_MODE=databricks-api` set in `app.yaml`
- [x] `DATABRICKS_HOST` set to `https://adb-604667594731808.8.azuredatabricks.net`
- [x] `SQL_WAREHOUSE_ID` set to `e76480b94bea6ed5`
- [x] `POH_CATALOG` and `CQ_CATALOG` set to `connected_plant_uat`
- [x] `sql` OAuth scope in `effective_user_api_scopes`
- [x] App service principal has READ on `connectio-v2` secret scope
- [x] App deployed and `state: RUNNING`

### C2 — OAuth header verification (CONFIRMED 2026-05-17)

- [x] `token_present: true` — `x-forwarded-access-token` is being injected
- [x] `user_header_present: true` — `x-forwarded-user` is being injected
- [x] `email_header_present: true` — `x-forwarded-email` is being injected
- [x] `token_length_bucket: "long"` — token is a real OAuth JWT
- [x] `gap-auth` response header confirms authenticated user identity
- [x] `ENABLE_AUTH_DIAGNOSTICS` removed from `app.yaml` (disabled 2026-05-17)

### C3 — CQ lab plants (native Databricks) ✓ PASSED 2026-05-17

```
GET /api/cq/lab/plants
```

- [x] Response header `X-Adapter-Mode: databricks-api` present
- [x] No SPN/PAT token used — query executes as the end user's identity

### C4 — POH order header (native Databricks) ✓ PASSED 2026-05-17

Tested with process order `7006965038` (plant C113, MIXED BERRY FLV LQD 70373871, status: closed).

### C5 — Auth failure cases ✓ PASSED 2026-05-17

- [x] Without auth (no cookie / expired session): returns HTTP 401 — Databricks Apps gateway rejects before reaching FastAPI
- [x] Confirmed no 200 with mock data when token is absent

### C6 — No SPN/PAT fallback ✓ PASSED 2026-05-17

- [x] `databricks apps logs connectio-v2` — zero entries containing `service_principal`, `client_secret`, or `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`
- [x] `X-Data-Source` header confirmed `databricks-api` on C3 and C4

---

### C17–C21 — Warehouse360 native routes — PENDING RE-TEST

**Status: PENDING RE-TEST** — Config set, source views fixed, LIMIT fix deployed. Awaiting browser re-test after second deploy (2026-05-18).

**Config confirmed (2026-05-18):**
- `WH360_CATALOG=connected_plant_uat` set in `app.yaml` ✓
- `WH360_SCHEMA=wh360` (default — confirmed correct for UAT) ✓
- Known warehouse IDs: **104**, **105** ✓

**Source view fixes (2026-05-18):**
- Overview: `wh360_cockpit_summary_v` **does not exist** — replaced with `wh360_kpi_snapshot_v` (global single-row KPI snapshot, confirmed via DESCRIBE + SELECT). No WHERE clause (no warehouse_id column). 11-column SELECT: `orders_total, orders_red, orders_amber, trs_open, tos_open, deliveries_today, deliveries_at_risk, inbound_open, bins_blocked, bins_total, bin_util_pct`.
- `LIMIT :max_rows` **rejected by Databricks SQL** — all 4 list routes (inbound/outbound/staging/exceptions) returned HTTP 502 in first test. Fixed by embedding `LIMIT 1000` literal directly in SQL and removing `max_rows` from params dict.
- `connected_plant_uat.wh360.wh360_inbound_v` — **exists** ✓ (confirmed first test round)

**First test result (pre-LIMIT fix, 2026-05-18):**
- `GET /api/warehouse360/overview?warehouse_id=104` — **HTTP 200** ✓ (after source view fix)
- `GET /api/warehouse360/inbound?warehouse_id=104` — **HTTP 502** ✗ (LIMIT :max_rows rejected)
- `GET /api/warehouse360/outbound?warehouse_id=104` — **HTTP 502** ✗
- `GET /api/warehouse360/staging?warehouse_id=104` — **HTTP 502** ✗
- `GET /api/warehouse360/exceptions?warehouse_id=104` — **HTTP 502** ✗

Second deploy with LIMIT fix completed 2026-05-18. Re-test pending.

- [x] `WH360_CATALOG` set in `app.yaml`
- [x] `warehouse_id` known for UAT (104, 105)
- [x] Overview view name confirmed (`wh360_kpi_snapshot_v`)
- [x] `LIMIT :max_rows` fixed (literal `LIMIT 1000` embedded in SQL)
- [x] C17: Overview — **HTTP 200** ✓ (`wh360_kpi_snapshot_v`, LIMIT 1, no warehouse_id filter)
- [ ] C18: Inbound — **PENDING RE-TEST** (`wh360_inbound_v` exists, LIMIT 1000 fix deployed)
- [ ] C19: Outbound — **DDL-BLOCKED** (`wh360_deliveries_v` has no `WAREHOUSE_NUMBER` column — need `DESCRIBE TABLE` to find correct filter column)
- [ ] C20: Staging — **SOURCE-BLOCKED** (`staging_orders_v` does not exist in `connected_plant_uat.wh360` — need `SHOW VIEWS` to find alternative)
- [ ] C21: Exceptions — **SOURCE-BLOCKED** (`wh360_imwm_exceptions_v` does not exist in `connected_plant_uat.wh360` — need `SHOW VIEWS` to find alternative)
- [ ] `x-data-source: databricks-api` on each unblocked route

---

### C22 — SPC sandbox/demo labelling — PASS (code-audit fixed 2026-05-18)

**Status: CODE-FIXED** — `SPCSandboxBanner` was present only on `chart-overview` and `characteristic-review` views. Added to `active-signals`, `capability`, `alarm-history`, and `chart-configuration-readonly` via f.txt code audit.

**UAT: tab-walk each view tab at `?workspace=spc-monitoring` to confirm banner is visible on all 6 tabs.**

- [ ] `chart-overview` tab — banner visible (was already present)
- [ ] `active-signals` tab — banner visible (fixed 2026-05-18)
- [ ] `characteristic-review` tab — banner visible (was already present)
- [ ] `capability` tab — banner visible (fixed 2026-05-18)
- [ ] `alarm-history` tab — banner visible (fixed 2026-05-18)
- [ ] `chart-configuration-readonly` tab — banner visible (fixed 2026-05-18)
- [ ] No view claims native Databricks or live production data
- [ ] Charts load without crash (demo data)
