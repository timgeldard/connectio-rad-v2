# ConnectIO V2 — Architecture Overview

ConnectIO V2 replaces the legacy app-centric launcher (Trace, SPC, EnvMon, POH, Warehouse360) with a
workspace-first operational platform. Users navigate by jobs-to-be-done — "Trace a batch", "Release a
process order", "Review SPC alarms" — and the shell assembles the relevant evidence panels automatically.
App names become internal implementation details; domain-integration packages contribute workspaces to a
shared registry rather than exposing standalone entry points.

## How to Run

```bash
# Install TypeScript dependencies
npm install

# Dev server — shell at http://localhost:4200
npx nx run web:dev

# API server — at http://localhost:8000
cd apps/api && uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Storybook — design-system component catalogue
npx nx run design-system:storybook

# All TypeScript tests
npm run test

# Python tests
cd apps/api && uv run pytest
```

## How to Test

```bash
# Unit tests — pure logic packages
npx vitest run packages/product-model packages/data-contracts

# Component tests — runtime packages
npx vitest run packages/evidence-panel-runtime packages/workspace-runtime

# E2E smoke suite
npx playwright test --grep @smoke

# Python API tests
cd apps/api && uv run pytest
```

## Boundary Rules

**Design system**: All `@radix-ui/*`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, and `lucide-react` imports are confined to
`packages/design-system`. All other packages and apps import from `@connectio/design-system` only. A
`no-restricted-imports` ESLint rule enforces this boundary at typecheck time.

**Cross-integration imports**: Domain-integration packages (`domain-integrations/*`) must not import from
each other. Each integration depends on shared packages only. Cross-domain data flows through the workspace
shell via `WorkspaceContext` and `EvidencePanelRegistration.allowedConsumerWorkspaces`.

**Panel dependency direction**: Evidence panels (`evidence-panel-runtime`) must not import from
`workspace-runtime`. The dependency is strictly one-way — workspaces host panels, panels do not reference
workspaces.

**Databricks SQL**: All SQL execution uses `packages/python-db` (`shared_db`). Direct `import databricks`
is prohibited in application code.
