    Source: single-hop upstream VENDOR_RECEIPT walk from gold_batch_lineage joined
    to gold_supplier on SUPPLIER_ID. Returns one row per distinct supplier with
    aggregated quantity, receipt count, last-receipt date, and uom.

    Empty-string SUPPLIER_ID handling: lineage rows where SUPPLIER_ID is NULL or
    empty string ('') are filtered at SQL. Live data on 2026-05-20 showed 9 of 10
    direct-parent VENDOR_RECEIPT rows for the UAT candidate had SUPPLIER_ID = ''.
    These represent unattributed inputs (intra-company transfers, missing data)
    and are not real third-party suppliers; they are excluded by design.

    Multi-hop walks are out of scope for this first slice. The query returns
    direct-parent VENDOR_RECEIPT suppliers only. Multi-hop is a separate concern
