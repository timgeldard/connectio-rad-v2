# Trace App slice — getBatchQualityPassport (partial: identity + stock + production)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The Quality Passport response has 7 sections (identity, quality, stock,
# production, lotHistory, massBalance, signoff). This slice covers the three
# that can be sourced from already-verified gold views. The remaining four
# (quality.coa, lotHistory, massBalance variance/note, signoff) and the
# confidence score require future sources and stay mock-only.
#
# A frontend integration that wants partial real data can call this endpoint
# for identity/stock/production and merge with the existing mock for the rest.

def get_batch_quality_passport_partial_spec(request: Trace2BatchQualityPassportRequest) -> QuerySpec:
    """Return a QuerySpec for the verified-source portion of the Quality Passport.

    Sources (all verified live in connected_plant_uat.gold via the 2026-05-25
    Databricks repository compatibility audit — see
    docs/data-layer/trace2-batch-quality-passport-source-verification.md):
      - gold_batch_stock_v               → stock buckets (per plant)
      - gold_batch_summary_v             → manufacture / expiry dates only
      - gold_material                    → material description, base UoM
      - gold_plant                       → plant name
      - gold_batch_production_history_v  → process order, posting date,
                                            batch quantity, UoM

    Removed projections (columns absent from live DDL — caused
    UNRESOLVED_COLUMN before this fix):
      - b.PROCESS_ORDER_ID (gold_batch_summary_v has only MATERIAL_ID,
        BATCH_ID, MANUFACTURE_DATE, SHELF_LIFE_EXPIRATION_DATE,
        MATERIAL_NAME, MATERIAL_TYPE, MATERIAL_DESC_SHORT, days_to_expiry,
        shelf_life_status)
      - ph.START_DATE, ph.CONFIRMED_DATE, ph.PLANNED_QTY, ph.ACTUAL_QTY,
        ph.PRODUCTION_LINE, ph.OPERATOR (gold_batch_production_history_v
        has only PROCESS_ORDER_ID, BATCH_ID, PLANT_ID, MATERIAL_ID,
        POSTING_DATE, BATCH_QTY, UOM, quality_status)

    Mapping decisions:
      - process_order_id now comes from gold_batch_production_history_v
        (PROCESS_ORDER_ID), not gold_batch_summary_v.
      - production_started_at maps from POSTING_DATE. This is the
        production-history posting date and is NOT claimed to be the
        confirmed production start timestamp — the live view exposes no
        START / CONFIRMED timestamps.
      - production_actual_qty maps from BATCH_QTY. This is the actual
        batch quantity recorded on the production-history posting, NOT a
        planned quantity — the live view exposes no planned-vs-actual split.
      - production_uom is selected as ph.UOM but is currently not surfaced
        through the Production contract (which has no production-uom
        field); the row key is kept so a future contract addition can
        consume it without re-touching the SQL.

    Intentionally unavailable (no live source column — the mapper emits
    contract defaults to keep the response body shape stable):
      - production_confirmed_at
      - production_planned_qty
      - production_line
      - production_operator

    Plant filter is respected when supplied — leave plant_id='' to take the
    first row by sort order (consistent with the existing batch-header route).
